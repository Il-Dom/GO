						<p>We can summarize GO rules as follow:</p>
						<li><span>1.</span>
							<p>
								Two players, "Black" and "White", play on a goban with unlimited stones of their colour.<br>
								At the beginning of the game all intersections are empty (or free). The goban doesn't contin stones.<br>
								The two players alternate with each turn. "Black" begins. Every player can insert his stone on a free intersection.
							</p>
						</li>
						
						<li><span>2.</span>
							<p>
								Stones of the same color that are on adjacent intersections (vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally) are said to be connected.<br>
								Two or more stones, directly or indirectly connected to each other, form a group. Even an isolated stone can be considered a group (the smallest of the groups, of course).<br>
								Each group of stones or a single stone have a certain number of free intersections around themselves, taking into account only those that can be connected horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. <br>
								The number of free intersections are called group or stone liberties.	
							</p>
						</li>
						
						<li><span>3.</span>
							<p>
								On the goban groups without liberties cannot exist. If the last liberty has been removed from the adversary, then all the stones of the group are removed from the goban 
								because the group has been captured (or killed).<br>
								Following the capture of stones or groups, it is unlawful to recreate a similar situation on the goban (the KO rule).<br>
								When a player passes his turn without playing, the other can continue. <br>
								If both players pass their turn the game is considered over.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li><span>4.</span>
							<p>
								At game's end:
								It's establish the leadership of the regions. A player own a region if the adversary can't plays inside of it without getting his pawn captured. 
								The points of each player are counted: for each player are counted the number of free intersections.
								The winner is the player with the greatest number of free intersection.
							</p>
						</li>
